 Why I am Building It

As an active trader, I found most tracking apps lacked the simplicity and flexibility I needed. So I started building my own, a platform that fits my trading workflow, expands my full-stack skills, and showcases my ability to ship and learn independently.



 Features ( So Far ! ) 

- Live crypto price ticker
- Real-time crypto news integration
- Secure login and dashboard
- Portfolio snapshot and journal overview
- SQL-based logging system for trade entries (in development)
